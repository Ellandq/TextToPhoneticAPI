To launch the js API:
node server.mjs

To launch the .NET API:
Dunno I use Rider so it does it for me but you just need to launch either the HTTP or the HTTPS one for it to work

currently, the API is accessible at:
http://localhost:5282/api/phoneticconversion

With a body:

{
  "text": "Some text goes here"
}
